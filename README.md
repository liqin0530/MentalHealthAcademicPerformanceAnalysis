# 🧠 The Impact of Mental Health on Academic Performance

This project investigates the relationship between mental health and academic performance using statistical analysis in SAS. Developed as part of a university research project, it aims to uncover insights that could support better academic support systems for students.

---

## 📊 Objective

To analyse how different mental health indicators — such as stress, sleep, anxiety, and emotional well-being — affect academic outcomes (e.g., GPA, study consistency).

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **SAS** – for data processing, statistical analysis, and visualisation  
- **Survey Data (CSV format)** – from Kaggle
- **PROC** procedures (e.g., PROC MEANS, PROC CORR, PROC REG) – used for analysis  

---

## 🔍 Key Components

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
  - Imported and formatted data using `PROC IMPORT`  
  - Handled missing values and outliers using `IF` statements and conditional logic

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Used `PROC FREQ`, `PROC MEANS`, and `PROC UNIVARIATE` for summary statistics  
  - Created visualisations with `PROC SGPLOT` to identify trends

- **Statistical Analysis**  
  - Conducted correlation analysis with `PROC CORR`  
  - Performed regression analysis using `PROC REG` to evaluate predictors of academic performance

---

## 📝 Findings

- Students with better mental health generally performed better academically.
- Those experiencing frequent stress, anxiety, or depression were more likely to report lower academic performance.
- Students with strong support systems (family, friends, counselling) and good time management tended to perform better.
- Effective coping strategies positively influenced both mental well-being and academic results.
